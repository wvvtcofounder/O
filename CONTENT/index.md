# Welcome to WVVT

**Low power, high impact.** WVVT is community radio — built by listeners, for listeners.

We believe radio belongs to the people. Whether you're tuning in from your kitchen, your car, or your workshop, you're part of something real.

## What We Do

- **Local music** — Showcasing artists from our community
- **Community voices** — Your stories, your airwaves
- **Independent media** — No corporate playlists, no algorithms

## Get Involved

WVVT runs on volunteer energy. Want to host a show, help with events, or just say hello? We'd love to hear from you.

*Stay tuned. Stay local. Stay loud.*
